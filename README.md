## Introduction

The OWASP Top 10 is a widely recognized list of the top 10 most critical web application security risks. It provides a prioritized list of security risks for web application developers and organizations to address. Users can identify OWASP vulnerabilities easily. Additionally, this project can help in providing a hands-on training to the developers and security professional to identify the vulnerabilities and understand the remediation process, also will help in providing a simulated environment for penetration testing and vulnerability assessment for the security professional to gain knowledge and experience.

Importance of this project is, The project is packaged as a Docker container, which makes it easy to deploy and run on any system that has Docker installed. This allows developers and organizations to easily run the project on a wide range of platforms and environments, and eliminates the need to manually set up and configure dependencies. Users can simply "plug and play" the project by running the docker container which all needed dependencies and infrastructure such as databases, web servers, and it will be ready to use. This makes it easy for them to quickly and easily test the project and start using it to identify OWASP vulnerabilities in web applications.

This platform will be easy to use, as the project comes with detailed documentation and web interface that helps users to understand the process of identifying vulnerabilities, and the process of remediation. The interface helps users to navigate the project and access the features easily. The project is designed as a containerized solution, which makes it portable across different environments and platforms. This makes it easy to deploy and run the project in different environments, such as development, testing, and production. This is designed to be easily scalable, allowing users to run multiple instances of the project to scan large web applications.This project is maintained by a team of experts in web application security, ensuring that the information and tools provided are up-to-date and effective, and focus on transparency and user feedback ensures that it is always improving and staying ahead of the latest threats.


## Technologies
